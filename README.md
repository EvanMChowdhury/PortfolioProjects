 Hi there! \
\
My name is Evan Chowdhury and I\'m looking to switch careers from a Chemical Engineer with some programming/data visualization experience to a Data Analyst\
\
I\'ve spent the last few months gaining skills in Python/Excel/SQL/Pandas/Tableau and some other python libraries\
\
This Github repository is designed to showcase these skills through projects\
\
Finished working with the 2015 flights dataset from the Department of Transportation\
And queried this data to answer questions through MySQL and Python/Pandas \
And visualized my findings using Matplotlib and Tableau
\
Additionally analyzed Video Game Sales data with Excel using Pivot Tables \
And created a dashboard to visualize findings
\
Currently gaining skills in Power BI and working through this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/  \
\
Please reach out if you have interest in discussing more and possibly setting up an interview\
