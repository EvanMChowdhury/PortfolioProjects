\f0\fs24 \cf0 Hi there! \
\
My name\'92s Evan Chowdhury and I\'92m looking to switch careers from a Chemical Engineer with some coding experience to a Data Analyst/Scientist\
\
I\'92ve spent the last couple months gaining skills in Python/Pandas/MySQL/Tableau and some other python libraries\
\
This Github repository is designed to showcase these skills through projects\
\
Currently finished working with the 2015 flights dataset from the Department of Transportation\
Found at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays\
\
And querying this data to answer questions through MySQL and Python/Pandas \
\
In the near future, will visualize these findings through both Matplotlib and Tableau \
\
Please reach out if you have interest in discussing more and possibly setting up an interview\
