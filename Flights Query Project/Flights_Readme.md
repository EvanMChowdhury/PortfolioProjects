Here you can find my project taking the 2015 flights dataset from the Department of Transportation \
And querying this dataset to answer questions such as "How many flights per airline were on the runway for > 45 minutes?" 
\
The objective of the project is to show my skills in programming/querying and data visualization\
\
This project contains 12 questions answered through MySQL and Python/Pandas, found in SQLFlightsProject.sql and Pandas_SQL_Flights_Notebook.ipynb respectively \
Additionally contains visualizations of some of these questions through Matplotlib and Tableau
